### Employee Attrition Prediction

#### Project Description
Employee Attrition Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave an organization based on various employee-related features. The model helps organizations identify attrition risks and take preventive actions.

#### Objective
To build a supervised machine learning model that classifies employees as likely to leave or stay using historical HR data.

#### Dataset
The project uses a Kaggle employee attrition dataset containing employee demographic, job-related, and performance features, with Attrition as the target variable.

#### Technology Used
  * Python

  * Pandas

  * Scikit-learn

  * Streamlit

#### Machine Learning Model
  * Random Forest Classifier

#### Features
  * Data preprocessing and encoding

  * Employee attrittion prediction

  * Confidence score for predicitions

  * Interactive web interface using Streamlit

#### How to Run
  * Install dependencies - pip install -r requirements.txt
   
  * Train the model - python train_model.py

  * Run the application - streamlit run app.py

#### Output
The system predicts :

        * Whether an employee will leave or stay

        * The confidence score of the prediction
